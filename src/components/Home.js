        Math-magicians is a fictional company based in France.
        They have requested your help to build a simple product
        that would assist them with their calculations.
        An important thing to notice is that they have asked
        for a product that is just fully-functional and it
        does not need to be beautiful and user-friendly (at least in its first version).
